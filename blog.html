                            fullContent: "In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), data has become the new currency. In this global race, organizations with the most data will likely come out ahead. However, AI cannot solve all the world's problems. The successful implementation and application of AI depends on the quantity and quality of data. Collecting large amounts of high-quality data is only part of the AI ​​lifecycle. Organizations must also be able to extract valuable information from the data and turn it into practical insights. Therefore, organizations must continuously leverage the latest data to train AI models to avoid model hallucinations and drift. There is a knowledge gap here. This gap that exists between security professionals who understand AI and those who don’t will be a major reason for the changing balance of power among threat actors. The existence of AI is inevitable, and the question we must ask is: do security leaders and professionals have the skills required, or are they willing to invest the time to upskill and learn how to respond to what is becoming the largest ever crisis? technological revolution. Harnessing the power of this technology, and defending against it, both depend on the ability to understand it and its limitations.<br><br>The only way to fight AI is to use it, but before that you have to master the basics. Defending against AI ultimately means defending against all indexed human knowledge. In this age of unlimited information, security professionals must protect their organizations and face unprecedented challenges. In other words, if we have been trying to do the basic things well, an excessive shift toward using AI to solve problems will be largely benign. The best way to mitigate attacks is to ensure that basic controls for security are addressed. We often chase shiny things like AI, and the AI's best defense is strong base control. Therefore, when discussing &quot;security by design,&quot; we not only need to consider AI tools and models, but also make them the focus. If AI is the inevitable future of how organizations and critical infrastructure do business, operate, develop services, etc., then security must be built in from the start. AI must be designed and implemented in a way that solves many of the historical concerns of the web.<br><br>If we only see safety when constructing governance processes in AI discussions, but never see safety in its production, operation, or adjustment processes, the reasoning of the model will often be ignored, but it is safe. key part. Many business leaders believe that AI will solve problems immediately, automatically, and that it will magically work. For example, a model doing the &quot;right thing&quot; depends on accuracy, which depends on training the model and reducing the chance of hallucinations. If we continue to prioritize creativity and speed over accuracy in AI, large language models will fall into hallucinations. Securing models throughout their entire lifecycle (build, test, and production) will be a focus for security teams and regulators in the coming years.<br><br>When we create new technologies that significantly change the way we do business, there is often over-excitement and a glass-half-full mentality - often focusing solely on the opportunities presented rather than weighing the risks. AI is a victim of this cycle. The good news, however, is that the industry is still in the smoke and mirrors phase of AI, testing its power and exploring use cases. We now either spend time learning techniques to identify and address potential signal flares, or we become low-hanging fruit for hackers to exploit. Most importantly, we cannot let innovation and excitement outweigh security and resiliency."

Cybersecurity covers a series of operational specifications and methods aimed at maintaining the operation of IT systems, protecting information security, and resisting various potential risks. However, with the rapid development of technology, especially the popularity of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT), network security is facing unprecedented challenges. These emerging technologies not only change the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, but also introduce new security threats, such as deepfakes or self-evolving malware. How these technologies are used to carry out network attacks and why they pose challenges to existing network security strategies are issues that we need to explore in depth.<br><br>The main task of network security is to ensure that various types of systems can resist possible attacks at all levels during operation, so as to ensure that the continued operation of the system will not be jeopardized. At the same time, network security also needs to ensure that data will not be stolen by hackers during data transmission and storage. Network security can be further subdivided into several levels, including Network Security, Application Security, and Data Storage Security. These are to ensure the security of information and prevent it from being stolen or damaged during transmission or storage.<br><br>The advent of the AI ​​era has brought some challenges and hidden worries to network security. Generative AI and machine learning are increasing the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, putting new pressures on companies. This technology allows cybercriminals to launch sophisticated and stealthy attacks, such as deepfakes or self-evolving malware, to disrupt systems at scale. The widespread use of AI may lead to accidental data leakage, which also brings unprecedented challenges. For example, adversaries can exploit large language models to increase attack efficiency and exploit additional vulnerabilities introduced by the model. The deployment of large language models requires rethinking the way security is approached. This is a more dynamic, interactive and customized process. Not only do we need to take security into account during the design phase – ensuring we build secure models and prevent training data from being contaminated (Data Poisoning) – but we need to continuously evaluate and monitor the system after deployment to ensure it is safe, secure and ethical.<br><br>The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era has also brought some special challenges and concerns to network security. The sheer number of IoT devices and their integration into public life have made IoT devices a coveted target for hackers. These devices can contain many vulnerabilities, and because they are often connected to the network, they can be targets for attacks. Secondly, IoT devices may collect and transmit large amounts of data, including some sensitive personal information. If the security measures on these devices are insufficient, data leakage may result. Furthermore, many IoT devices may not be regularly updated or patched, making them more vulnerable to attacks. For example, some devices may not receive automatic updates, or users may not know how to update their devices. The IoT industry lacks consistent security standards and specifications, making it more difficult to protect these devices from attacks.<br><br>Important aspects of AI security include AI trust, AI ethical application and AI network security. AI trust involves the degree of people's trust in the AI ​​system, including the transparency and explainability of its decision-making process, as well as the impartiality and fairness of its decision-making. The ethical application of AI involves whether the use of AI technology is consistent with moral and social values. For example, AI should avoid bias and discrimination and respect users’ privacy and data rights. In addition, the application of AI should also consider its impact on society and the economy to avoid unfair results. AI network security involves the security of the AI ​​system itself and how AI can be used to enhance network security.<br><br>Facing the cybersecurity challenges in the AI ​​and IoT era, we need to adopt a series of strategies and measures. We need to strengthen cybersecurity education and training for the public and professionals, raise people's awareness of cybersecurity threats, and provide the necessary skills and knowledge to defend against these threats. Develop and enforce stricter regulations to protect individuals and organizations from the threat of cyberattacks. Ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically and requires appropriate regulatory mechanisms to prevent abuse, strategic investments to protect data, including investment in data security technology, and the establishment of effective data management policies and procedures.<br><br>In this era of rapid change, CIOs and CISOs need to pay close attention to changes in technology and regulations and ensure that the organization can comply with the latest regulations, establish a company culture that values ​​cybersecurity, and find innovative ways to attract and retain cybersecurity Professional talents. In addition, strategic thinking is needed to deal with possible risks and challenges, including geopolitical changes and the impact of emerging technologies. Ensure their organizations have adequate resources to protect themselves from cyberattacks and continue to invest in data security and management technologies and policies.<br><br>Overall, cybersecurity is an evolving field that requires us to continually learn, adapt, and innovate. Only in this way can we effectively protect our information systems and ensure the security and prosperity of our digital world."

In terms of business operations, I understand the success of a company does not solely depend on speed, but rather on a solid foundation and precise strategy. This is like the 'speed' in martial arts, which is built upon diligent training and strong capabilities, not just sheer velocity. Similarly, the development pace of a company is based on robust management and accurate growth strategies.<br><br>If a company only pursues speed while neglecting to strengthen its internal management and constitution, it may fall into chaos as it expands, possibly leading to a decline in revenue or even business failure. Therefore, companies need to eliminate the bad habit of merely 'only seeking speed' and focus on accumulating strength and capabilities, reinforcing their business constitution with solid management and precise development strategies. Only when a company's capabilities are enhanced will its development pace naturally increase. A company can experience explosive growth when it has accumulated enough exceptional strength and energy, and only then will it have the managerial strength to sustain such growth without losing control due to high growth. This is the growth cycle of a company.<br><br>In summary, the success of a company does not solely depend on speed, but rather on a solid foundation and precise strategy. Only when a company's capabilities are enhanced will its development pace naturally increase, which is the key to sustainable and continuous excellence.<br><br>We can see that many well-known companies, such as Apple, Google, and Amazon, have achieved success through solid foundations and precise strategies. They not only focus on product innovation and quality but also pay attention to internal management and employee training, allowing them to maintain a leading position in the highly competitive market. On the other hand, we have also seen companies like Blockbuster and Kodak, which pursued speed too much and neglected to strengthen their internal management and constitution, resulting in their downfall. Therefore, we need to learn from these cases, eliminate the bad habit of 'only seeking speed' and focus on accumulating strength and capabilities. This goal can be achieved by providing high-quality products and services, enhancing employee's skills and knowledge, and implementing effective management strategies.
